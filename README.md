# Hashgraphs-for-P2P-Communication-in-VANETs
This repository contains initial codes for the project. This may contain few bugs. This repository is published just for basic information regarding what's happening in the project. For more details, kindly see the README file.


We suggest using hashgraph, integrating with IoT instead of using blockchain for ensuring road safety. Compared with the previous systems using blockchain technology and other methods for ensuring road safety, our approach guarantees that neither the data is stored at a single location nor is managed by the particular entity. We chose hashgraph algorithm because this algorithm does not require Proof-of-Work (POW) and provides minimal cost and high efficiency. This also does not require high power and electrical supply for computation.
The proposed model based on the hashgraph was validated through a simulation on OMNeT++, as well as by fabricating a piece of IoT hardware to synchronize the model during the deployment. OMNeT++ provides a network simulation facility in the form of a modular extensible component-based C++ library
